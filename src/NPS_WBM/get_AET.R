#' Actual Evapotranspiration (AET)

#' Calculates actual evapotranspiration (AET) from available water, PET, and soil water.
#' @param w  A time series vector of available water for soil charging (rain + snowmelt).
#' @param pet A time series vector of PET.
#' @param swc A time series vector of soil water content.
#' @param swc.0 (optional) The initial soil water content value. Default is 0.
